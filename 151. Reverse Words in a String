class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        a = s.split(' ')
        a = [i for i in a if i!= ''][::-1]
        return ' '.join(a)

This is optimal and TC -> O(n)
if it's return ' '.join(a[::-1]) -> then the runtime is more. Hence, better to reverse it before passing to join function.
