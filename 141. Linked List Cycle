class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        a,b = head, head
        # if a == b:
        #     return True
        while (a and b and a.next and b.next):
            a = a.next
            b = b.next.next
            if a == b:
                return True
        return False

This is good but the condition can be optimized and checking b.next and b would be enough and optimal.
